# Overtime
This assignment focuses on the relationship between requirements, implementation, and testing.
The original description of the Overtime program was given to teams of participants in a programming contest.
The source code in this repository is what one team submitted, it compiled and ran, but was ruled as incorrect by the judges.

## Original Description / Requirements
You have just joined the working world at a job that pays $10 an hour. However, you do get some additional bonuses.
The normal workday is 8 hours in length, but any hour beyond 8 for that day is paid an additional $2. 
Furthermore, if your weekly total exceeds 40 hours, $4 is paid for each additional hour (the $2 and $4 are
additive and may both be earned for the same hour).  Finally, a 100% bonus is paid for whatever you earn on a Saturday,
and a 50% bonus for whatever you earn on Sunday.

## Your Task
Your task in this assignment is to identify and resolve the defects to make the program work correctly. The definition
of correctness may be in question. There may be defects in the following areas:
* defects in the implementation (source code), this is where most people tend to focus
* defects in the requirements in the way they are written/expressed
* defects in the test cases

You are free to do any of the following:
* rewrite/restructure the requirements to match the intention of the judge (instructor)
* rewrite/restructure the code
* rewrite/restructure the test cases (hint: add more test cases)

You may choose to keep it simple, or you may choose to go more elaborate. You will be assessed on
getting the requirements, implementation, and testing correct; but if you choose to go fancier, that
is extra (above and beyond, but perhaps a chance to practice what you know).

You may work together on this assignment, per reasonable collaboration per the academic policies (no copy-pasting).
Although most of this assignment is done individually, you will likely need to reach out to get clarification
on the requirements.

Submit the following:
* revised requirements here in Git/GitHub, perhaps in a new file named revised-requirements.md
* revised code here in Git/GitHub
* revised test cases here in Git/GitHub
